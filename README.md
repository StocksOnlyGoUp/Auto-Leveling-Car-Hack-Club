# Auto-Leveling-Car-Hack-Club

Description:
Inspired by the Bose Electromagnetic suspension system in the 80s, which allowed cars to compensate for imperfections in the roads nearly perfectly, this project aims to build a 1:18 scale RC car that automatically compensates for imperfections in its path fully from scratch.
